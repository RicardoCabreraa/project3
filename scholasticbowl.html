<h1>Scholastic Bowl Rules</h1>
<p>The way a game is typically played is that you have a set of 20 toss up question which are worth 10 points each. If you can correctly answer the question your team can then
answer 3 bonus questions all relating to a topic and all also worth 10 points. If you answer any question with in the first sentence being read you get a power which means 15 points
instead of the normal 10. You can talk with your team during bonus questions but not during toss ups. If someone from your team gets a problem inncorrect the whole team can no longer
answer and the opposing team gets either the rest of the question read out or 3 seconds which ever is longer to answer.</p>
